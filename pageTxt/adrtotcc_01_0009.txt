Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar 9

To approach the lunar cycle, clearly Equos would have had to have
fewer than 30 days in years 2 and 4.

In years 1 and 5 and presumably in year 3 (with lacunae) there
are 5 IVOS days at the end of Equos, beginning on day 26 and
continuing to day 4 of the following month Elembiu (years 1 and 3
extant) to give a total of 9 IVOS days for each of years 1, 3, and 5.
However, the IVOS notation extends to day 5 of Elembiu in year 2 with
the end of Equos missing because of lacunae. This extension of the
IVOS festival suggests that Equos is missing some days in year 2, and
the total length of this IVOS festival period would otherwise be
foreshortened. The end of Equos and the beginning of Elembiu are
missing in year 4. The ending of the IVOS festival is unknown here.
Remember also that Equos is listed as an ANM “incomplete” month
even though years 1, 3, and 5 clearly have 30 days. This extra IVOS
day in the beginning of Elembiu in year 2 and the notation ANM
describing Equos is why previous observers such Mac Neill and Pinault
have suggested that Equos had fewer than 30 days in year 2, and by
extrapolation, year 4 as well, where the final part of Equos and the
entire month of Elembiu are missing. As we shall see, if it were not the
case that Equos had fewer than 30 days in these years, the calendar
would go hopelessly out of whack with both lunar and solar time.

In the 30-year cycle after an initial 5-year phase of 1801 days
in which solar time falls back by 25.21 days (5 X 365.2422 = 1,826.21
days), there follow five 5-year phases of 1831 days during which the
sun regains 4.79 days in each 5-year period so that after 5 such 1831-
day periods the sun has gained back 23.95 days. Thus in every 30-year
period the sun falls back by 1.27 days with respect to the calendar. The
calendar priests in their counting schemes would have assumed an
initial fall back of 25 days during the first 5-year phase and that the sun
gained back this fall-back by 5 days in each subsequent 5-year phase,
giving a series of 5-year Intercalary-1 solstice dates occurring at the
beginning of each 5-year phase of 1, 26, 21, 16, 11, 6. But notice that
the sun actually is still one day later than the daily notation of the
calendar so the next 30-year cycle would give intercalary-1 solstice
dates of 2, 27, 22, 17, 12, 7 etc (see Olmsted 1992: tab. 24a).

However the counting schemes on the Coligny calendar
actually show a progression of TII 5-year intercalary-1 solstice counts
of 1, 25, 19, 13, 7 to be followed in the next 25- or 30-year cycle by ITI
day counts of 2, 26, 20, 14, 8 and in the final cycle by IIT day counts
of 3, 27, 21, 15, 9. To follow this progression one should consult plate
1,Sam 1 M, and one should also see on the month plates: month 1, year
2, where Samonios day 3 and the expected IIT mark have been
