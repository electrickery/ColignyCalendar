8 Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar

of the suggested AMB scheme rests upon its similarity to the other
more certain counting schemes on the calendar. Of necessity, I must
outline here the nature of the more certain counting schemes.

Before examining these other counting schemes one must first
give an outline of the arrangement of days on the calendar. In illustrat-
ing the sequence of variation of the 29-day and 30-day months on the
Coligny calendar outlined here, double slanted lines // indicate a six-
month division. I have used parentheses () around the intercalary month
and brackets [] around Equos. The month of Equos is singled out for
the following reason. Equos clearly has 30 days in years 1,3, and 5, yet
it strangely has the notation ANM, found elsewhere describing only the
29-day months. On the calendar all of the 30-day months have the
notation MAT or MATV. For this reason most observers of the
calendar have suspected that Equos had fewer than 30 days in either or
both of years 2 and 4. In the first year of each five-year period except
for the first year of a 25- or 30-year cycle, the Coligny calendar follows
the following pattern in the lengths of the months: (30) //, 30, 29, 30,
29, 30, 30, // 29, 30, [30], 29, 30, 29. In year 3 the pattern is 30, 29, 30,
29, 30, 30, // (30) //, 29, 30, [30], 29, 30, 29. The addition of the
intercalary months to years 1 and 3 causes each year to increase to 385
days, where they would otherwise contain 355 days. In addition to
counting the actual days in these years, the notation at the beginning of
the second intercalary month (in the middle of year 3) states that this
year contains a total number of days (LAT) equal to CCCLXXXV and
a total number of months (M) equal to XIII. Each of these years with
intercalary months has an average of 29.6154 days in each month. Year
5 does not have an intercalary month so the pattern is 30, 29, 30, 29,
30, 30, // 29, 30, [30], 29, 30, 29 to give 355 days. The months in this
year have an average of 29.5833 days each. If Equos had 28 days in
year 2, year 2 would contain only 353 days. For year-2 the pattern
would be 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 30, // 29, 30, [28], 29, 30, 29. The months
in this year would then have an average of 29.4167 days. If Equos had
29 days in year 4, year 4 would contain 354 days. For year 4 the pattern
would be 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 30, // 29, 30, [29], 29, 30, 29. The months
in this year would average 29.5000 days. Of course if Equos had 30
days in each of the years 2, 4, and 5, each would contain 355 days to
give the same pattern as year-5 above and an average monthly length
of 29.5833 days, which is considerably longer than a standard lunar
month of 29.5306 days and would cause the calendar to go out of
whack with lunar time by around half a day each year. The situation
would be even worse during years with intercalary months containing
385 days (13 months) and an average monthly length of 29.6154 days.
