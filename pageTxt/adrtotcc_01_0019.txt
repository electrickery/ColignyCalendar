Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar 19

Let us next examine the 25-year cycle which is actually
indicated on the Coligny calendar. This 25-year cycle is developed
from the 30-year cycle by adding an additional day every five years to
the 30-year-cycle calendar. In this 25-year calendar there is an initial
phase of 1802 days followed by four 5-year phases of 1832 days. In a
calendar with 5-year phases of 1832 days (as opposed to the 1831 days
of the 30-year cycle), shifting 1 day with respect to the moon every 5
years, since there are 1826.211 days in 5 solar years, the solstices will
occur earlier by 5.789 days (1832 - 1826.211) every 5 years. Four of
the 1832-day phases thus add 23.156 days. In this 25-year calendar,
these 4 phases, each generating 5.789 days, gradually eat away an
initial 24.21 1-day fall-back (1826.211 - 1802). Thus the 25-year cycle
will consist of a total of four 1832-day 5-year phases added to the
initial 1802-day 5-year phase. As the total from the last four 5-year
periods is not quite equal to the initial fall-back of the first 5-year
period, the sun will fall back 1.055 days (24.211 - 23.156) over the
whole 25-year cycle, almost exactly 1 day.

In these calendar schemes the two intercalary months,
comprising 60 days, are theoretically added to make up the supposed
60-days fall-back of the sun, 1 day for each month of the 5-year period.
But as we have seen above, in adding these extra 60 days, the sun
actually leaps ahead in each 62-month phase by either approximately
5 days or approximately 6 days, depending on whether the calendar
contains 1831 days or 1832 days. These extra intercalary days will then
cause the intercalary solstices to occur either 5 days earlier each phase
after an initial fall back of nearly 25 days in the 30-year cycle or 6 days
earlier each phase after an initial fall-back of nearly 24 days in the 25-
year cycle. In the first 25-year cycle, for example, after the first
midwinter solstice on day 1 of Samain, the midwinter intercalary
solstices will occur at 5-year intervals on days 25, 19, 13, and 7 and the
midsummer intercalary solstices will occur on days 28, 22, 16, 10, and
4,

To account for the discrepancy in the 60-days fall-back
predicted by the 1-day fall-back each month (the intercalary months are
not counted in the fall-back) and the fall-back actually observed in
cycling through the calendar, the N-counting scheme on the Coligny
calendar simply shifts forward a block of days once in each 5-year
period, a block of days equal in length to the number of days the sun
leaps ahead (the number of days the solstices occur earlier) in each
such period. If we closely examine the N-counts proceeding from the
