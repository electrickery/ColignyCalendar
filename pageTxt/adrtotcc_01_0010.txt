10 Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar

transferred to Samonios 2a, labeled tri(ti)nux samo “the third night of
Samonios” (also see Olmsted 1992: tab. 26a-28d). The TI marks and
the N counting scheme, clearly indicated on the calendar, all show this
same progression (see Olmsted 1992: tab. 43). Thus in Samain we have
prinni loudin 1, prinni loudin 7, TY 13, TH 19, TH 25 //; ITT 2, ITT 8,
ITI 14, ITI 20, ITI 26 //; WT 3, UT 9, WT 15, WT 21, WT 27. Notice in
the scheme the count is completed with only 5 five-year solstice dates
rather than the 6 five-year phases of the 30-year cycle and that each
solstice date is separated by 6 days rather than the 5 days of the 30 year
cycle. The only way this can happen is if the initial count is a 5-year
phase of 1802 days during which the sun progresses 1,826.21 days
falling back by 24.21 days, to be followed by four 1832-day five-year
phases in which the sun gains back 5.79 days in each five year phase.
Four of these 1832-day phases add up to 23.16 days (4 X 5.79), which
is 1.05 days shorter than the initial fall back. Of course the calendar
priests would have seen this as an initial 24-day fall-back to be
recouped in four 6-day advances, one occurring in each new five-year
phase. If the same 1-day overall fall-back in the sun was assumed in
each 25-year cycle as the ITI marks’ advancing by 1 day show (in
Samain TI = 1, 25, 19, 13, 7; ITI= 2, 26, 20, 14, 8; ITT = 3, 27, 21, 15,
9), then the whole scheme is error with the sun by only 0.05 days in a
25 year period. The N-count indicates the same dates as the TII scheme
(Olmsted 1992: tabs. 20, 26a-b).

The lunar reckoning of this 25-year calendar is interesting as
well. The 25-year calendar contains 9130 days (1802 + (4 X 1832)). 25
solar years contain 9131.05 days (25 X 365.2422), 1.05 days longer
than the calendar. The 25-year calendar contains an initial phase of 61
months followed by four phases each of 62 months for a total of 309
months. 309 lunar months contain 9124.95 days days (309 X 29.5306),
5.05 days shorter than the calendar. Thus year-26 begins with the sun
1.05 days behind the calendar and the moon 5.05 days ahead of the
calendar. These amounts total almost exactly 1 day behind for the sun
and 5 days ahead for the moon, a solar accuracy equivalent to the
Gregorian calendar. But notice that if the triple marks divide each 15-
day period indicated on the calender into 3 periods of 5 days each (the
Old Irish céicde), then with each 25-year phase the moon would shift
into the next 5-day week. Thus TII indicates not only the first 25-year
phase but the first 5-day week of the moon as well. ITI indicates not
only the second 25-year phase and falls appropriately one day later in
the calendar (for the 1-day fall back in the sun), but it also indicates the
second 5-day week of the moon. IIT not only indicates the third 25-year
phase and falls later by an additional day from ITI, but also indicates
