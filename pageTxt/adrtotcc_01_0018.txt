18 Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar

each month during the 30 months between each intercalary month. The
N notation, found at dates increasing by 1 day each month, counts out
this fall-back of the sun during a given 30-month period. On average
the Nâ€™s actually count only 27 days in each 2 1/2-year (30-month)
period, since a block of 6 days is skipped in each 5-year (60-month)
period. Thus both the intercalary-month notation and the N notation
fall on the same days of the month (but in differing years), although
each is an independent aspect of the way the calendar deals with this
solar fall-back. The similarity between the two items arises from the
fact that both the intercalary-month notation and the N-notation
independently increase a day for each month traversed, thus falling on
Samonios 1, Dumannios 2, Rivros 3, etc., each attempting to keep track
of the actual solar path.

To fully comprehend this situation, we must first examine the
actual solar and lunar pathways of the 30-year Gaulish cycle mentioned
by Plinius. In the course of a year (365.2422 days) the sun lags behind
12 lunar months (354.3671 days) by 10.8751 days, and in the course of
5 years (1826.21 1 days) it lags behind 60 lunar months (1771.835 days)
by 54.376 days (see table 45a). However, if 1 intercalary exact lunar
month (29.531 days) is added to the 60 months to make up the 5-year
period, the sun will lag behind exact lunar time by only 24.845 days.
If 2 intercalary exact lunar months are added, the sun will then be able
to leap ahead of exact lunar time by 4.686 days every 5 years. Five
such 5-year phases each with 2 intercalary months (5 X 4.686 = 23.430
days) will therefore come within 1.42 days of making up for one initial
5-year phase with 1 intercalary month (with 24.845 days fall-back).

Calendars, however, must deal with an whole number of days.
In a calendar with 1831 days in 62 months (as opposed to the exact
lunar cycle above with 1830.897 days in 62 months), since there are
1826.211 days in 5 solar years, the solstices will occur earlier by 4.789
days (1831 - 1826.211) every 5 years rather the 4.686 days of the
perfect lunar calendar above. Five of these 1831-day phases thus add
23.945 days. However, an initial phase of 1801 days will lose 25.211
days (1826.211 -1801). In this 30-year calendar, these five 1831-day
phases, each generating 4.789 days, gradually eat away this initial
25.211-day fall-back. Thus the 30-year cycle will consist of a total of
five 1831-day 5-year phases added to an initial 1801-day 5-year phase.
As the total from the last five 5-year periods is not quite equal to the
initial fall-back of the first 5-year period, the sun will fall back 1.266
days (25.211 - 23.945) over the whole 30-year cycle.
