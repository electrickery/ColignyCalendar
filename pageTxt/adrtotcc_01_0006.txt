6 Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar

the edge of a scaled ruler to a length of 3.0 Gaulish inches then gives
2.76 ± .02 cm per Gaulish inch for the more accurate multiple column
widths (2.76 ± .06 cm. for the individual columns). Examination of the
mean distance between columns and month names indicates that an
“inch” equal to 2.76 ± .02 cm was utilized for all of the measurements
on the calendar.

The Roman “foot” or pes was equivalent to 29.6 cm, yielding
a “inch” or uncia (equivalent to one twelfth of a Roman foot) of 2.47
cm. (.97 English inches with 2.54 cm. per English inch). Clearly the
calendar was not ruled off in standard Roman unciae. The long Greek
foot of 32.6 cm. yields an “inch” of 2.72 cm., considerably closer, but
still outside of the standard deviation of the most accurate measure of
the unit apparently utilized in ruling out the calendar. However, the
standard of Roman Gaul and Roman Germany during the late first
century BC, the pes Drusianus of 33.0 cm., yields an inch of 2.75 cm.
(1.08 English inches) (Price and Lang 1970: 659). Clearly this was the
measurement unit most likely utilized on the Coligny calendar. Since
the uncia Drusianus is only 1% larger than the Greek inch, it was
probably adopted by the Gauls from a unit used by the Greeks in
Massalia.

Operating under Tiberius, Drusus Germanicus subdued the
Raeti and the Vindelici in 15 BC. In 13 BC he was put in charge of the
three Gauls by Augustus. He dedicated an alter to Rome and Augustus
at Lugudunum (now Lyons) on August 1 in 12 BC (Momigliano and
Cadoux 1970: 365-6). Although the Coligny calendar plate is clearly
a copy of an earlier calendar plate, it’s present format was set up after
12 BC. Also since the calendar was found just outside of Lyons, it
would make sense that it was ruled out in the standard of the uncia
Drusianus, It seems likely that Drusus simply adopted the prevailing
Gaulish inch, since otherwise he would have utilized the Roman
standard. Thus the standard utilized on the calendar was most likely a
Gaulish “inch” of 2.75 cm. or 1.08 English inches.

The Coligny engravers began with a bronze plate measuring
134. 8 cm. long (49.0 unciae Drusianus) by 78.0 cm. high (28.4 unciae
Drusianus). With the rim attached the plate measured 52.0 by 32.0
unciae Drusianus. The engravers then began from the left side of the
plate and measured off 15 columns each 3.0 unciae Drusianus wide,
leaving the sixteenth column 3.5 unciae Drusianus wide. They began
next at the bottom of the plate and measured up 6.5 unciae Drusianus
for the bottom month-name line and 6.5 unciae Drusianus for each of
the next two month-name lines. For the top month names they
sometimes started a little above the standard line. The top month-name
