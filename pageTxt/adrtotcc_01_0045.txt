Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar 45

R: RI: *rion: "moon".

This term occurs as R and RI in the phrases GANO R, RIX -
RI, and N INNIS R. As we have seen previously, N INNIS occurs with
a statistical distribution on day 7 + 2 days in the first half of the month
and on day 8 + 2 days in the second fortnight of the month. It therefore
follows a distribution coinciding with the middle of the periods of the
waxing and waning moons in the original 30-year calendar. Since N
stands for "night", we are left with the conclusion that R and RI should
stand for "moon".

Irish ré "moon", as in ré nua "anew moon", seen as ultimately
arising from the significance of ré (10, n) as "a lapse of time, interval
of time", could be a derivative of an original Celtic neuter io-stem
*rion, genitive *rii, signifying both "moon" and "an interval of time”.
The IE root behind this word is *reé- "to figure, to count" (IEW: 59, 60,
853), also giving Irish rim and Welsh rhif "number".

RIX RI: *rix rii: "a measure of the moon".

This term occurs with a point of separation between RIX and
RI on Samonios 5 in year 1. RIX may derive from *rék-t-s with the
root *rék- meaning "to put in order, to reckon" (IEW: 863). Here then
a Gaulish *ricts giving rix could indicate "a measure". It is perhaps
significant that it occurs at the end of the first five-day week, a
*quonquedivi giving Irish cdicde.

[SJAMMEN M: ?*sammeni? mids: "a month of ?summer?”.

This term occurs at the beginning of the second intercalary
month. Here then I would see Celtic sam- "summer", as in Irish sam
and Welsh haf from IE *sem- "summer" (IEW: 905). If so, it verifies
that Giamonios, which the second intercalary month immediately
precedes, is normally the first month of summer,

SIND: SINDIV: "this day".

The term SINDIV is equivalent to Irish indiu "today".
