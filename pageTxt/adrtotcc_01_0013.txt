calendar in each 5-year phase. Furthermore, in place of MacNeill’s and
Plinius’s 30-year cycle, such a calendar follows a 25-year cycle. In such
a repetitive 25-year cycle the sun falls 1.055 days behind the calendar
and the moon runs 5.048 days ahead of the calendar in each cycle (as
opposed to 1.266 days error for the sun and 0.151 days error for the
moon in the 30-year cycle).

Under the scheme of the 25-year cycle the normal sequence of
marks TII, ITI, IIT, each falling one day apart, can be explained as an
indication of the regular 1-day lag in the sun in each such 25-year
cycle. Thus the triple marks stand for a triple sequence of 3 separate
25-year cycles. Since with each advance in a 25-year cycle the months
all begin in a new 5-day week of the moon, the three mark-types (TII,
ITI, IIT) also stand for a 3-fold division of each lunar fortnight (with
3 five-day phases in each fortnight). For each new 25-year cycle the TII
marks then indicate the advance of the lunar-week phases as well.

The nature of the TII mark thus not only indicates the 5-day
week phase of the moon under which the months in each 25-year cycle
begin, but the mark also denominates the cycle as a whole. Further-
more, to the 5-day lunar-week indicated by the TII mark one can simply
add an additional day for each 5-year phase passed through in the 25-
year cycle to keep exact track of the moon. The TII mark then gives not
only the number of the 25-year cycle and the corresponding fall-back
of the sun, but the 5-day phase of the moon with which each month
begins in that cycle as well!

With the TII marks the calendar then keeps track of the regular
1-day regression of the sun and the 5-day progression of the moon with
respect to the calendar in each 25-year cycle. The actual reckoning of
the position of the sun would be off by only 0.055 days and that of the
moon by only 0.048 days in each 25-year cycle. Thus the calendar
scheme falls into error with respect to either body by less than 1 day in
every 455 years!

This extreme accuracy of the 25-year cycle may be compared
to the error in the 30-year cycle of 0.266 days with respect to the sun
and 0.151 days with respect to the moon in each 30-year cycle (with the
30-year calendar assuming the same 1-day known lag of the sun and an
exact lunar sequence; see 1992: tables 45a and 46a and b). Under the
30-year cycle the reckoning with respect to the sun would fall into error
by 1 day every 113 years, an accuracy in itself comparable to that of
the Julian calendar, but in no way approaching the accuracy of the 25-
year cycle. The lunar reckoning for the 30-year cycle is more accurate
than the solar reckoning, being off by 1 day every 199 years.
