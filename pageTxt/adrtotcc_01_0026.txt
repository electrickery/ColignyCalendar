process, and the archaism of the suffixes otherwise makes it difficult
to recognize what the terms are. Outside of my own studies (1988b,
1992: 79-85) only TRI(TIO) and PET(VAR)I have been recognized
independently as numerals (Thurneysen 1899: 540; Lambert 1996: 110,
112). Since the origins of the shifted days can be established independ-
ent from any etymological speculation from the TIl-mark patterns
alone, it can be determined further that the TRI(TIO) “third” of
SAMON found on day 17 of SAMON indeed comes from the third day
of that month, the PET(VAR)IV “from the fourth’ of RIVRI found on
day 25 of RIVROS indeed comes from the fourth day of that month,
and the PET(VAR)IV “from the fourth” of ANAGANT found on day
23 of RIVROS indeed comes from the fourth day of ANAGANT. It is
clear here that we deal, moreover, with the ordinal rather than the
cardinal form of these numerals. Since the *ALE (single attested
corrupted form ELE) “from the second” of DVMAN found on the
SAMON day 3 comes from the second day of the ANTENOVX of
DVMAN, the OC(T)IOMV “from the eighth” of RIVRI found on day
4 of ANAGANT comes from the eighth day of the ANTENOVX of
RIVROS, the DECIOMIV “from the tenth” of RIVRI found on day 13
of RIVROS comes from the tenth day of the ANTENOVX of RIVROS,
and the *7RI(TIODE)CIOM V(single attested corrupted form BRIC-
IOMV for *7RICIOMV) “from the thirteenth” of RIVRI found on day
4 of RIVROS comes from the thirteenth day of that month, other
ordinal numeral forms become apparent as well. Without a study of all
of the forms in relationship to one another, a determination of the
pattern of shifted days, a determination of the pattern of the TII marks,
and a determination of the origin of the shifted days, only one of these
ordinal forms, PETIV, would have been readily recognized. Even
worse, endless unsupported etymological speculation as to their
significance in isolation would continue to masquerade as scholarship.

The archaic ordinal numerals suggested by these corrupted
abbreviations are *(a)lios; *tri(ti)os; *pet(ur)ios, *pet(uor)ios or
*pet(uar)ios; *oc(t)iomos; *deciomos; and *(t)ri(tiode)ciomos or
*(t)ri(de)ciomos. These ordinal forms correspond to PIE *aljos IEW:
25), *tritjos (IEW: 1090-1), *kyetur-jos (IEW: 642-3), *oktomos or
*oktoyos (IEW: 775), *dekemos (IEW: 191). These ordinal forms also
correspond to attested Gaulish forms from La Graufesenque alos, allos
(Lambert 1995: 131, Thurneyson 1946: 249, but Ir. aile (< *alios),
tritios (Lambert 1995: 131), petuarios (Lambert 1995: 131), oxtumetos
(Lambert 1995: 131-2), decometos, decametos (Lambert 1995: 131-2,
