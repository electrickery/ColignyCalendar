the third 5-day week of the moon. With each 5-year phase the moon
progresses by exactly one additional day within each week dominating
the 25-year cycle.

Notice that this 25-year cycle has 1802 days and 1832 days in
the 5-year phases rather than the 1801 days and 1831 days of the 5-year
phases in the 30-year cycle. This extra day in each 5-year phase would
arise by giving Equos 29 days in year 4 rather than the 28 days in year
4 necessary for the 30-year cycle. Equos would still have 28 days in
year 2 accounting for the extra IVOS day in Elembiu year 2. Thus in
years 1, 3, and 5, the IVOS count for the end of Equos and the
beginning of Elembiu would be 9 days with 5 IVOS days at the end of
Equos (30 days) and 4 IVOS days at the beginning of Elembiu. In year
4, 4 IVOS days would occur at the end of Equos (29 days) and 4 IVOS
days would occur at the beginning of Elembiu for a total of 8 days. In
year 2, three IVOS days would occur at the end of Equos (28 days) but
now 5 IVOS days would occur at the beginning of Elembiu for a total
of 8 days. Like MacNiell’s scheme, the 25-year scheme still accounts
for the extra IVOS day in Elembiu year 2. The ANM notation for
Equos is assured in both counts since Equos has fewer than 30 days in
years 2 and 4.

It is clear that the 25-year calendar was adapted from Plinius’s
30-year Gaulish calendar by simply giving an extra day to Equos in
year 4 making it 29 days long rather than the original 28 days. It is the
completeness of these schemes and their accounting for the TI
distribution that caused Pinault to call for the adoption of my 25-year
scheme in his Gnomen (1996: 706 ff.) review.

A Brief Description of the TII Counting Scheme

The TII scheme (plate 1) normally counts only in the MAT
(30-day) months in the first half of the year when the sun daily rises in
the sky (the /oudin half of the year) and in the ANM (29-day) months
in the second half of the year when the sun daily lowers in the sky (the
laget half of the year). The loudin "rising" solar pathway thus occurs
in the 4 MAT "complete" months in the first half of the year, and the
laget "lowering" solar pathway occurs in the 4 ANM "incomplete"
months in the second half of the year. In this scheme 3 days are added
each time the count shifts from a MAT to an ANM month or vice
versa, which normally occurs at 6-month intervals. In this way the TII-
count normally tallies out 12 days each year (one day for each month),
the same as with the N-count, to be discussed below.
