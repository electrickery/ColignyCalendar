Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar 5

struction of the Coligny calendar verifies that my 1992 reconstruction
of the distribution of the notation on the calendar is one certainly
capable of fitting within the surviving parameters of the calendar. To
the extent that the 1992 reconstruction accurately discerns the
repetitive patterns on the calendar, it is one that is likely to be correct.
For anyone attempting to understand the nature and working of the
Coligny calendar, the 1992 reconstruction is adequate.

Nonetheless the computer-driven transcription given here does
more accurately reflect the probable original wording of the abbrevi-
ated terminology and the alignment of this notation on the calendar. In
this sense it is technically more accurate, although the 1992 reconstruc-
tion just as accurately reflects the semantic content of the original
calendar. Aside from verifying the adequacy of the 1992 transcript, one
of the major results of this study is to bring to light new details about
the engravers techniques and the minute linear and chronological units
utilized on the calendar which previously had been unnoticed.

The Engraversâ€™ Techniques

The first task of this new study was to determine the measure-
ment system utilized in ruling off the lines and columns of the calender,
so that the measurements utilized in ruling off the original calendar
plate could be preserved in the reconstruction. Measurements across
multiple columns with interconnecting fragments yield the most
consistent results indicating that a standard length was used to rule off
the columns of the calendar. Ten measurements across from 2 to 5
different columns (ave. 3.2 columns), defined by the rows of Roman
numerals set forth for the days of the calendar, give 8.27 + .06 cm. or
3.26 + .02 inches per column (8.20, 8.27, 8.40, 8.20, 8.24, 8.30, 8.27,
8.20, 8.30, 8.27 cm. per column). The average of fourteen individual
measures from the full-scale photographs given in RIG: III give similar
results of 8.29 + .17 cm or 3.26 + .07 in. (3.24, 3.18, 3.30, 3.34, 3.29,
3.23, 3.28, 3.16, 3.30, 3.34, 3.22, 3.38, 3.19, 3.26 in. per column) but
with three times the margin of error.

The increased margin of error across individual columns is to
be expected if the engraver used a ruler laid out across the plate and
marked out the columns to plus or minus one fifteenth of an inch. Ifa
movable block equal to one column in width had been used to
established the standardized column widths, the error across three
columns would be increased by a factor of the square root of three
times that found across single columns or + .10 in., five times larger
than that actually found. Assuming each column was marked off along
