Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar 23

The D AMB scheme would count the hours later than sunset
the moon sets each day beginning with the new moon as follows: (new
moon) ID 1 hr, I D 2 hrs, [i] D 3 hrs, INI D 4 hrs, V D AMB 3 hrs, VI
D 4hrs, VITD 5 hrs, VII D 6 hrs, VIII D7 hrs, X D 8hrs, XI D AMB
7 hrs, XII D 8 hrs, XIII D 9 hrs, XIII D 10 hrs, XV D 11 hrs; (full
moon) ANTENOVX ID 12 hrs, ANTENOVX IID 1 hr, ANTENOVX
fil D AMB 12 hrs ANTENOVX IDI D 1 hr, ANTENOVX V D AMB
12 hrs, ANTENOVX VID 1 hr, ANTENOVX VII D AMB 12 hrs,
ANTENOVX VIII D 1 hr, ANTENOVX VIII D AMB 12 hrs,
ANTENOVX X D 1, ANTENOVX XID AMB 12 hrs, ANTENOVX
XII D 1 hr, ANTENOVX XIII D AMB 12 hrs, ANTENOVX XIII D
1 hr, ANTENOVX XV D AMB 12 hrs; (new moon) ID 1 hr, etc. Here
the indication 12hrs would be equivalent to O for the hours till moon
rise following the sunset.

Notice that the scheme does count the time of moon set
between the period between the new moon and the full moon, assuming
the new moon occurs at the beginning of each month, as occurred at the
beginning of the 1000-year period during which the 30-year calendar
was in use. During the ATENOVX half of the month, assuming this
occurs between the full moon and the new moon, when the moon rises
and sets an hour later each day and the crescent becomes smaller and
smaller, a period of increasing darkness, the D AMB counting scheme
simply ratchets between 12 hrs (0 hrs) and 1 hr. The whole scheme
simply counts the time elapsed till the onset of the period in which
starlight will be the sole source of light after sunset. The calendar
seems to be only interested in how much additional time each night
will be lighted by the moon after sunset and has no concern with how
much additional moonlight is added to the period preceding dawn.
Obviously if a sundial is the sole means of telling time, the span of time
preceding dawn could not be accurately determined.

Such a scheme indeed suggests the use of a sundial which
Starts each day at a sunrise of 1 oâ€™clock; the calendar counts around the
additional hours of lightness which will be added to daylight by
moonlight after sunset. Perhaps in the pseudo-science of the calendar,
this D-AMB counting of the period the moon sets later each day may
have been tied to the concept of the noux sonno, whence its importance
in being noted on the calendar.

If this analysis is then correct, it indicates that not only did the
Gauls utilize an inch measure to subdivide the foot, but they subdivided
the day into 12 hours as well. Although the unciae Drusianus is certain,
