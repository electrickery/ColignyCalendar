20 Reconstructed Text of the Coligny Calendar

intercalary solstices at Int-1 days 25 and 13 (see 1992: tables 20 and
26b), we see that the counts actually do skip 6 days. With such a
scheme one can keep track of the sun with an inherent variational error
of about + 3 days. But note carefully since 6 days rather than 5 days are
leaped over in the Coligny N-counts, the calendar must have had 1832
rather than 1831 days.

Although on the Coligny calendar the N-counting scheme
adopts a 6-day shift consistent with an 1832-day calendar, the N count-
ing scheme system itself makes more sense as a solstice predictor in a
calendar with 1831 days. With the present 6-day shift, the count leaps
over the solstices in Qutios in years 6 and 16 (1992: table 26b). With
a 5-day shift it would not do this (1992: table 24a-b). This leap over
the two solstices suggests that the present 1832-day calendar (recycling
every 25 years) actually developed from an earlier 1831-day exact
lunar calendar (recycling every 30 years).

Adopting a 5-day leap, alternately at the beginning and in the
middle of each 5-year phase, this earlier 183 1-day calendar then simply
moved the N forward a day each month to account for the approximate
1-day fall-back of the sun each month. Such a calendar is capable of
predicting solar positions within + 3 days and is inaccurate by an
additional 1 day ever 113 years. In keeping track of the sun, this purely
lunar calendar assumes a 1-day known shift every 30 years.

The counting scheme of the 1831-day calendar is simple
enough that it could have been used in a purely oral calendar. Indeed,
the known shift of the calendar with respect to solar time by | day
every 30 years suggests that the calendar was deliberately allowed to
progress 1 day earlier with respect to the sun every 30 years. This 1-day
fall-back of the sun with respect to the calendar every 30 years has the
effect of shifting every 30 years the lunar festivals associated with the
solstices and equinoxes 1 day earlier than solar time and the actual
events these festivals commemorate. On the Coligny calendar such
festivals are labeled IVOS and always occur as a block of days
centering around day 1 or 1a.

As noted, such a 30-year cycle calendar would have to have
been in operation for 1000 years to explain why the months began on
the sixth day of the moon as recorded by Plinius. By his time the
Gaulish calendar had shifted by five days from the original scheme of
the months beginning on the first day of the moon (1 day’s shift for
each 199 years). The term ATENOVX “returning night” (indicating the
full moon) on the sixteenth day of each month of the Coligny calendar
